# SupariMC
SupariMC is an amazing tool for Minecraft checking, made with Python. It features a Cloud Mode that utilizes GitHub Actions for cloud-based combo checking, eliminating the need for a dedicated server.

This project was initially created as part of a bet with a friend, and while it is currently functional, there is room for improvement. I am currently unable to work on this project due to my board exams, but I have plans to continue developing it in the future.

My focus will shift towards checking research for the new Microsoft account, as the Mojang account is set to be discontinued. In the meantime, I welcome any contributions or improvements to the current features from my classmates or other community members.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I apologize for any delayed replies, as I am currently unable to dedicate as much time to my GitHub projects as I would like.
